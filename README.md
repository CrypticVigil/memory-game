## Dependencies

None. I have a link to the Font Awesome icon set. Everything else is basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No Bootstrap used.

## Instructions

Simply open the index.html file to begin. Start by clicking pairs of cards to see if you can find a match. Once you've matched them all, a pop-up will let you know how quickly you won and how many moves it took.
